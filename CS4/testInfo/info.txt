The server needs to have the following get request handler.

app.get("/operation", function(req, res){...});

It needs to have the following query values.

req.query.num1
req.query.num2
req.query.oper   ('Add', 'Multiply', 'Factorial', 'Power')

For the Power operator, you can use Math.pow().

It needs to return in res.json() a string that might look like

"4 * 3 = 12"
