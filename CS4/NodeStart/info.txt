From Node Modules:Part One
We could use the javascript Math.random() function, but we are looking
at node modules.

node package manager. (npm)

Create folder randomNum2
bring up command prompt and go to this folder.
now type

npm init
...
package name: (randomnum)    //hit enter
version: (1.0.0)    //hit enter
description: Generates a random number from 1 and 10   //type the description to the left
entry point: (index.js)   //hit enter so that index.js is the name of the file
test command:   //hit enter
git repository:   //hit enter
keywords:   //hit enter
author: Mr. Yee
license: (ISC) UNLICENSED

{
   "name": ...
    ...
   "license": ...
}

Is this ok? (yes)  //hit enter

//when we hit enter then the above will be written to a file named package.json and above is in json format.
//json stands for java script object notation

package.json is so that if you publish the package for others to download, this info is needed and is good practice.

To show above, get rid of node_modules and type     npm install
now look node_modules and you will not see anything since no modules were asked to be installed.

npm search random      //will list all packages with the word random in it.

or go to npmjs.com and do a search on random.
really want to search seedrandom.

now go back to command prompt and type

npm install seedrandom     // this will create node_modules folder with seedrandom module in it and package-lock.json
                           // which is related to versioning which we won't worry about.

!!!!look at contents of package.json to see if seedrandom dependecy is there.

npm install seedrandom --save   // thought you needed --save to put into dependencies in package.json, 
                                // but may do it without --save??  Look now at package.json to see if seedrandom has been added.

!!!!remove seedrandom from node_modules and do npm install

it is possible to see additional modules that you were not expecting, this might be caused by the module having
dependencies on other modules.  Also, other modules could have bugs.  You can see the code in the module itself
to fix a bug.  It is a community of people providing modules.

=====================================
create file named index.js and put into it

//Script to pick a random number from 1 to 10

//Require the seedrandom module
const seedrandom = require('seedrandom');

//Create a random number.
let rng = seedrandom();                       //3 ways to define variables  var, let, const
let myRandomNumber = Math.floor(rng()*10+1);
console.log(myRandomNumber);


Save the file then type in the command prompt

node index.js
